A template to parsable tree transformer used to produce valid HTML content.

This project aim is to provide a unified transformer across these projects (or more)

  * [domtagger](https://github.com/WebReflection/domtagger)
  * [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML), based on _domtagger_
  * [lighterhtml](https://github.com/WebReflection/lighterhtml), also based on _domtagger_

This project is responsible for eventual bad transformations so that updating this once, will fix all dependents.
